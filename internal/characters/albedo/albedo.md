## asc(hex) | Hexerei: Secret Rite
    After creating a Solar Isotoma, nearby party members' Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Plunging Attack, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst DMG are increased by 4% for every 1,000 DEF Albedo has for 20s. The maximum increase that can be achieved this way is 12%.
    After generating a Silver Isotoma, nearby Hexerei party members' Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Plunging Attack, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst DMG are increased by 10% for every 1,000 DEF Albedo has for 20s. The maximum increase that can be achieved this way is 30%.

## c1 (additional buff)
    Additionally, the use of Albedo's Elemental Skill Abiogenesis: Solar Isotoma also increases his DEF by 50% for the next 20s. 

## c2 (additional buff)
    Additionally, when Albedo is not on the field and when the stack count of Fatal Reckoning reaches 4, all stacks of Fatal Reckoning are consumed. This generates 3 Fatal Blossoms near your character, which will violently bloom to deal AoE Geo DMG equal to 300% of Albedo's DEF, DMG that will also be considered Elemental Burst DMG. Where the Passive Talent Homuncular Nature has also been unlocked, the Elemental Mastery of nearby party members will also increase by 125 for 10s. 

## c4 (additional buff)
    Additionally, when a nearby active character on the team jumps near a Silver Isotoma, the Silver Isotoma will be destroyed while greatly increasing the height of that jump, and for the next 3s, said character will deal 30% more Plunging Attack ground impact DMG. This effect is removed 0.1s after Plunging Attack ground impact DMG is dealt. 

## c6 (additional buff)
    Additionally, use of the Elemental Burst Rite of Progeniture: Tectonic Tide destroys all Silver Isotomas present on the field, and whenever a Silver Isotoma is destroyed this way the current instance of Elemental Burst will also remove 4 stacks of Fatal Reckoning from the Constellation Opening of Phanerozoic. This increases the DMG dealt by Fatal Blossom by 250% of Albedo's DEF for the next 20s.
